- Even if far from large airports, you may be closer than you realize to:
  - Seaplane bases
  - Smaller airports
  - Heliports
  - Agricultural aircraft operations

### Airspace Categories:

#### **Two Main Categories:**
1. **Controlled Airspace**
   - Includes areas around most airports
   - Designed to protect aircraft arriving at or departing from airports
   - Size and shape varies depending on airport needs
   - Requires authorization before flying

2. **Uncontrolled Airspace**
   - Includes most airspace starting at ground level and away from airports
   - **Uncontrolled does NOT mean unregulated**
   - Still requires compliance with all rules under Exception for Recreational Flyers
   - Limited to 400ft AGL without specific authorization

### Airspace Classification Chart:

#### **Class A Airspace**
- FL 600 (18,000 MSL) and above
- Upper limit undefined

#### **Class B Airspace**
- Major airports
- Typically up to 10,000 feet MSL
- "Upside-down wedding cake" shape
- Most restrictive for drones

#### **Class C Airspace**
- Busy airports with control tower
- Generally up to 4,000 feet AGL
- Circular shape with outer shelf

#### **Class D Airspace**
- Smaller airports with control tower
- Generally up to 2,500 feet AGL
- Circular shape

#### **Class E Airspace**
- Controlled airspace not classified as A, B, C, or D
- Can start at surface or various altitudes
- Default controlled airspace

#### **Class G Airspace**
- Uncontrolled airspace
- Surface up to either 700 or 1,200 feet AGL
- Where most recreational flying occurs

### Altitude Restrictions:
- **Uncontrolled airspace:** Limited to 400ft above ground level (AGL)
- **Controlled airspace:** Limited to UAS Facility Map (UASFM) altitudes
- Unless specifically authorized by the FAA

> Do NOT fly beyond your signal strength!

### Signal Loss Facts:
- You can lose signal from:
  - Interference
  - Weak connection
  - Distance
- If you lose signal, you may lose control of the drone

### Emergency Planning:
**Understand what will happen if you lose signal:**
- Will it land?
- Return to home?
- Crash?

**Plan what you'll do if you lose signal** to keep yourself, your drone, and others safe.

---

## 🤖 AUTOMATED FEATURES

### Core Principle:
A recreational flyer should know how automated features work **before** using them.

Many drones can be programmed to:
- Fly particular routes
- Follow patterns
- Perform aerobatic tricks
- All without additional pilot input

### Critical Responsibility:
> **The person flying is responsible for the drone at ALL times...even when using automated features.**

### ⚠️ Do NOT Rely on Automation!
**Do not rely on automated features to fly the drone without knowing what it will do!**

Essential skills:
- Understand how to safely turn automated features ON and OFF
- Do NOT rely solely on:
  - Geofencing
  - GPS signals
- Know when and how to take MANUAL control

### Risks of Automated Features:
**Common automation hazards:**
- **Return to home:** Drone may fly directly back and hit obstacles in its path
- **Autoland:** May land straight down into trees, water, or power lines
- **Follow me:** Can hit obstacles or people near you

---

## ✈️ PRACTICE FLIGHTS

### Best Practice Guidelines:
For first flights or testing new features:
- Go to areas with **very few obstacles**
- Ensure **no other people nearby**
- Fly in **open, non-populated areas**
- Practice until comfortable with predictable flight paths

### Why Practice Matters:
- Practicing with automated features is the best way to gain experience
- Minimizes risk of hitting someone or something
- All pilots (manned or unmanned) need considerable practice
- Never be surprised by what your aircraft does

### Skill Maintenance:
- Get practice flights if you haven't flown in a while
- Skills diminish over time without practice
- Flying a drone is a skill that requires regular practice
